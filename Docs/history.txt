History of SetSB
----------------

v.02b - First version; very buggy. I was in a hurry, ok? :P
v.03b - Fixed pointers, removed a few unneccesary variables, made code more
        compact, & made code compilable with GNU C Compiler.  Compiled using
        GCC and DJGPP libraries.
v.91b - Revamped the code; now uses cout & cin streams, a few assembler
        routines, and file streams. Code is easier to read. Took 12 hours
        and learned AT&T syntax for assembler, found out that DJGPP doesn't
        like all Borland file stream commands. Made "vol" structure more
        compact. Removed uneccessary variables.  Compiled using DJGPP.
        Included both DJGPP source file and Borland C++.
